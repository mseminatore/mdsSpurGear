Number of teeth\r\n2. Diametral pitch (*default is __24__*)\r\n3. Pressure angle (*default is __20__*)\r\n4. Shaft diameter (*default is __0.125__*)\r\n5. Gear thickness (*default is __0.125__*)\r\n6. Major holes (*default is __on__*)\r\n7. Minor holes (*default is __on__*)\r\n8. Number of holes (*default is __4__*)\r\n9. Hub thickness ratio (*default is __1.0__ which means __no hub__*)\r\n10. Smooth teeth (Experimental so *default is __off__*)\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-53302501-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
